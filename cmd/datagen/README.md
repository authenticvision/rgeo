# datagen

Command datagen converts GeoJSON files into go files containing functions that
return the compressed GeoJSON, it can also merge properties from one GeoJSON
file into another using the -merge flag (which it does by matching the country
names). You can use this if you want to use a different dataset to any of those
included, although that might be somewhat awkward if the properties in your
GeoJSON file are different.

### Usage

    go run datagen.go -o outfile infile.geojson

The variable containing the data will be named `outfile.gz`.

rgeo reads the location information from the following GeoJSON properties:

	- Country:      "ADMIN" or "admin"
	- CountryLong:  "FORMAL_EN"
	- CountryCode2: "ISO_A2"
	- CountryCode3: "ISO_A3"
	- Continent:    "CONTINENT"
	- Region:       "REGION_UN"
	- SubRegion:    "SUBREGION"
	- Province:     "name"
	- ProvinceCode: "iso_3166_2"
	- City:         "name_conve"
